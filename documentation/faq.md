## What units are available?

Pacer defines several quantities that require the user to specify the units. In general, we have:

- **distance:** `meters`, `kilometers`, and `miles`. Short versions can also be specified: `m`, `km`, and `mi`. There are also several built-in values:

  - `marathon`
  - `half-marathon` or `hmarathon`

  Note that these do not take in a unit. The unit will be based on the context, and if it is ambiguous, defaults to `kilometers`.

- **duration:** "time strings" like `1h2m3s` for `1 hour, 2 minutes, and 3 seconds`. Each component is optional e.g. `1h3s` or `2m`.

- **pace:** `<duration> /<distance>` e.g. `5m30s /km`. Note that `meters` are not allowed with paces; only `kilometers` or `miles`. In cases where the context is clear, the trailing unit is not required. Also note that because paces are always given in terms of `1 km` or `1 mi`, the full versions are *singular*, not plural e.g. `4m /kilometer`.

Parsing is designed to be moderately flexible, so numeric values can optionally be separated from the units by whitespace (quotes are then required) e.g. `'4 km'` or `4km`.

### Examples

```
--distance 5m
--distance '42 km'
--distance '42km'
--distance marathon
--distance '10 miles'
--distance '10 mi'

--duration 1h2m3s
--duration 4m30s
--duration 300s

--pace '4m20s /km'
--pace 5m/mi

# Pace unit can be omitted when it can be inferred from context e.g. no need
# to specify 'km' twice here:
#
$ pacer derive --distance 42km --pace 5m
3h 30'00"

# The pace unit is also not required when it is irrelevant e.g. when
# scaling:
#
$ pacer scale --pace 5m -k 0.9
4'30"
```

## What is NPM, and why do I need it?

[NPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm) is the "node package manager", and the `chart` command requires it to be installed, since we use `node` to build the charts. See https://nodejs.org/en/download for installation instructions.

To test installation, verify that `npm -v` works and returns some version:

```
# The version does not necessarily have to be the same.
$ npm -v
10.9.0
```
